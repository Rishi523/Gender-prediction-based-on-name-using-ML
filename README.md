Gender Prediction Based On Name Using ML



The goal is to build a model that can predict whether a given name is associated with a male or female gender. This is achieved by training a machine learning model on a dataset containing names labeled with their corresponding genders.

The provided code demonstrates a basic implementation of this concept using Python and scikit-learn:

Data Preparation:

The code loads a dataset from a CSV file (assumed to be named "name_gender_dataset.csv").
Names are converted to lowercase for consistent processing.
The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
Feature Extraction:

The CountVectorizer is used to convert names into numerical features based on character n-grams (2 to 3 characters).
Model Training and Prediction:

A Naive Bayes classifier (specifically, MultinomialNB) is chosen for training.
The model is trained on the training set using the extracted features.
Predictions are made on the test set using the trained model.
Evaluation:

The accuracy of the model is calculated by comparing its predictions with the actual gender labels in the test set.
The accuracy is displayed as the final result.
Keep in mind that this is a simplified example meant to introduce the concept. In practice, more advanced techniques can yield better results. The accuracy of the model depends on the quality and diversity of the dataset used for training, the choice of features, and the complexity of the chosen algorithm.

Results could vary based on factors such as the dataset's size and diversity, the quality of feature extraction, the chosen algorithm, and the dataset's inherent biases. If the model's accuracy is low, you might consider exploring more advanced algorithms (like neural networks) or improving feature engineering techniques.
